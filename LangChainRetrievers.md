#### Embedding Models

Embedding models capture the essence of any text- a tweet, document, or book in a single, compact representation. These models take text as an input and produce a fixed-length array of numbers, a numerical fingerprint of the text's semantic meaning. Embeddings allow search system to find relevant documents not just based on keyword matches, but on semantic understanding.
